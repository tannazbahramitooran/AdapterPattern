What is Adapter design pattern?

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class
into the interface expected by the other.
This is commonly used when existing classes can't be modified or when an interface needs to be adapted to a new
system. The pattern involves creating an adapter class that wraps the existing class and translates its interface into the interface that the client expects.

public class EmployeeAdapter
{
    private readonly List<Employee> _employees;

    public EmployeeAdapter(List<Employee> employees)
    {
        _employees = employees;
    }

    public string ToJsonString()
    {
          string jsonString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_employees );
        return jsonString;
    }
}

You would use the EmployeeAdapter class whenever you need to convert a list of Employee objects into a JSON string. 
For example, if you have an API endpoint that needs to return a list of Employees as a JSON string, you could create an instance of the EmployeeAdapter class, pass it the list of Employees,
then call the ToJsonString() method to get the JSON string.

Benefits of the Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern offers several benefits:

- Allows for the reuse of existing classes, which can reduce development time and costs.
- The adapter pattern helps to keep your code decoupled and easy to maintain.
- It's easy to understand and implement.

Conclusion

The Adapter Design Pattern is a powerful and useful tool for connecting incompatible classes and interfaces. 
It allows existing classes to be reused, keeps code decoupled and maintainable, and is easy to understand and implement. 
If you find yourself needing to connect two incompatible classes, the Adapter Design Pattern is a great option.
